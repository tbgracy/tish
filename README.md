This project was created as part of a school project to apply web development concepts using Java and JavaServer Pages (JSP). The main objective of the project is to build an online T-shirt selling platform, providing a user-friendly experience.

For the UI, we used [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/) for a more eye pleasing result.
